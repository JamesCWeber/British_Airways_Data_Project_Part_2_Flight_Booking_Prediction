# Flight Booking Prediction (British Airways Data Science Project Part 2)
![Introductory Picture](Booking_Prediction.png)
## Introduction
This is Part 2 of a project from the [British Airways Data Science micro-internship](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/british-airways/data-science-yqoz). British Airways is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom and is the second largest UK based carrier based on fleet size and passengers. British Airways has merged with Iberia, Spain's flag carrier airline, creating the International Airlines Group.

In this task, I take on the role of a junior data scientist employed at British Airways. British Airways has tasked me with collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third party source. I am also tasked with creating a predictive model to help determine which customers will book a flight for the upcoming holidays. **In this part of the project, I will analyze and conduct feature analysis on flight booking data, train and test a Random Forest model to predict which customers will book a flight, analyze the model performance with a confusion matrix, conduct feature importance analysis, and present my insights on a PowerPoint slide.**

## Problem Statement
British Airways is taking a proactive approach towards attracting customers. Rather than hoping that a customer purchases flights for the holidays as they come into the airport, British Airways is using data from past bookings and predictive models to determine how they can sell their flights to prospective customers. **Using their booking data, we will create and modify features so that they can be used in a Random Forest model. We will then train and tewst the model and analyze it's performance in order to understand how predictive the data really was and whether we can feasibly use it to predict the target outcome (customers buying holidays). The results will be summarized in a Power Point Slide which will be used in a board meeting.**
